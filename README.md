# Our Design:

Open a ticket with a Help Desk, submitting your name, issue, and how much of a priority it is on a scale of 1-10(10 being the most important). Once you submit your issue, you or your friends can open as many tickets as you want. Once all the issues are submitted, the Help Desk analyzes each one in terms of priority, starting with the most important one, solving it, and going down the list.

## Additional features: 
Our Help Desk is not only snarky, but not helpful at all. Despite being able to keep track of its tickets and analyze them accordingly, it has no knowledge in solving any of its issues.

Note: When asked a yes or no question it is best to answer with "yes" or "no".

## Flow
Asks:
 • If you have a problem 
 • The nature of the problem
 • The severity of the problem
 • Whether there are more people with problems or if you have more than one problem
 • Whether you turned the machine of and on again
   - If no, it asks you to do so
 • If the machine now works
   - If yes, it ends positively
   - If no, it still ends but with a slight twist

## Priority
 • Priority is assigned by severity of the problem.
