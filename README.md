## Flow
Asks:
 • If you have a problem 
 • The nature of the problem
 • The severity of the problem
 • Whether there are more people with problems or if you have more than one problem
 • Whether you turned the machine of and on again
   - If no, it asks you to do so
 • If the machine now works
   - If yes, it ends positively
   - If no, it still ends but with a slight twist

## Priority
 • Priority is assigned by severity of the problem.
