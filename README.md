# Our Design:

Our design: open a ticket with a Help Desk, submitting your name, issue, and how much of a priority it is on a scale of 1-10(10 being the most important). Once you submit your issue, you or your friends can open as many tickets as you want. Once all the issues are submitted, the Help Desk analyzes each one in terms of priority, starting with the most important one, solving it, and going down the list.

Additional features: our Help Desk is not only snarky, but not helpful at all. Despite being able to keep track of its tickets and analyze them accordingly, it has no knowledge in solving any of its issues.
